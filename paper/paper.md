# Summary

Recent experiments measuring the temperature and polarization of the Cosmic
Microwave Background, like WMAP [@wmap13] and Planck [@planck18], produce all-sky maps at higher
and higher resolution.
Handling those datasets efficiently and studying their statistical properties
requires a discretization scheme on the sphere.
The Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelization, [``HEALPix``](https://healpix.sourceforge.io) [@gorski05], scheme (see Fig. 1)
has proven to be an excellent mathematical framework to store map-domain data
and efficiently compute their Spherical Harmonics Transform, whose Angular
Power Spectrum is one the most powerful tools to understand the early Universe.

![See how a sphere is first split into 12 base
pixels of equal area whose centers are aligned at three different latitudes. Then, each is further subdivided to achieve higher and higher resolution.](healpix_grid.png)

The ``HEALPix`` team provides FORTRAN, C++, IDL/GDL and Java implementations of the framework with simulation, analysis and visualization functionalities,
format definitions for [FITS files](https://healpix.sourceforge.io/data/examples/),
and extensive documentation of each routine and facility.

``healpy`` is a wrapper to the multi-threaded ``HEALPix`` C++ library in Python, it implements
a user-friendly interface for all ``HEALPix`` functionalities, most importantly a fast nearest-neighbor search and the decomposition into Spherical Harmonics coefficients.
It also adds utilities to read/write maps, Spherical Harmonics coefficients, and
Power Spectrum values as FITS files based on ``astropy.io.fits``.
Finally it provides extensive plotting functionality, i.e. Mollweide, Gnomonic and Cartographic
projections based on Matplotlib.
We also release a ``conda`` package on ``conda-forge`` and wheels on PyPI for Linux and MacOS. These packages
also bundle the ``HEALPix`` C++ library. Moreover, ``healpy`` is distributed as part of the ``HEALPix`` release package;
within the installation script, a single C++ dynamic library is installed in the target system and used both by the C++
binaries and by ``healpy``.

``healpy`` was designed to be used by professional cosmologists and students to analyze
outputs of Cosmic Microwave Background experiments. WMAP, Planck
and many other experiment in the field release their maps
in ``HEALPix`` FITS format that can be accessed, visualized, and analyzed with ``healpy``.
More recently, its usage spread to
other branches of Astrophysics including galaxy surveys e.g. [Sloan Digital
Sky Survey depth maps](http://risa.stanford.edu/redmapper/), Gamma-ray astronomy
e.g. Fermi [@deil17], and gravitational waves measurements e.g. LIGO [@singer16].
